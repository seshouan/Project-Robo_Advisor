# Module 15 Challenge - The Power of the Cloud and Unsupervised Learning

## Purpose
Combine Amazon Web Services development skills with Python, to create a bot that will recommend an investment portfolio for a retirement plan, based on user risk tolerance levels

## Approach
1. **Initial Robo Advisor Configuration:** Define an Amazon Lex bot with a single intent that establishes a conversation about the requirements to suggest an investment portfolio for retirement.

2. **Build and Test the Robo Advisor:** Validate that bot is working and responding accurately along with the conversation with the user, by building and testing it.

3. **Enhance the Robo Advisor with an Amazon Lambda Function:** Create an Amazon Lambda function that validates the user's input and returns the investment portfolio recommendation. This task includes testing the Amazon Lambda function and making the integration with the bot.

## Results
1. **All 4 test scripts passed**

2. **Recorded a video of the bot at work**: [RoboAdvisor Video](RoboAdvisor_sample.mov)

3. **Uploaded all AWS files for future recreation of the bot into the challenge repository**<br>
